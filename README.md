# Machine Learning(ML)---Data-Preprocessing and Outlier Detection and Feature Engineering TITANIC DATA
ðŸŽ¯ Objective: 

This project focuses on exploring and analyzing the banking sector dataset using Python, specifically employing libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. We will clean the dataset, handle missing values, detect outliers, and perform visual analysis to derive meaningful insights.

# Tasks:

Import the Titanic dataset and display its first few rows.

Identify key features (e.g., Pclass, Age, SibSp, Parch, Fare, Embarked, etc.).

Plot initial visualizations to observe relationships between features and the target variable (Survived).

**2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   
Identify missing values in the dataset.

Impute missing values using suitable strategies (e.g., mean/median for Age, mode for Embarked, etc.).

Ensure that categorical variables are properly encoded.

Detect and handle outliers in numerical features (e.g., Fare, Age).

**3: Feature Engineering:**

Title Extraction: Extract titles (e.g., Mr, Mrs, Miss) from the Name column and analyze their impact on survival.

Family Size: Create a new feature that combines SibSp and Parch to form FamilySize.

IsAlone: Create a binary feature to indicate if a passenger is alone (i.e., FamilySize = 0).

Fare Bins: Discretize the Fare feature into quartiles.

Age Bins: Group the Age feature into bins to capture age ranges.

Deck Feature: Extract the deck information from the Cabin column.

Interaction Features: Create interaction features that combine different variables (e.g., Pclass and Sex).

Feature Encoding: Encode categorical features using methods like One-Hot Encoding.
